# drRoon

drRoon is a Python script that automatically tags audio files and albums with Dynamic Range (DR) ratings extracted from foobar2000 dynamic range log files. This tool is particularly useful for music enthusiasts and audiophiles who want to organize and display DR information in their music libraries, especially when using Roon as their music management software.

## Features

- Recursively processes directories to find `foo_dr.txt` files
- Option to rename album folders with DR values
- Flexible tagging options for audio files (MP3, FLAC, M4A, DSF)
- Ability to mark processed folders to avoid re-processing albums

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the script:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/drRoon.git
   cd drRoon
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install mutagen
   ```

## Usage

Run the script from the command line, providing the root directory to process:

```
python drRoon.py /path/to/music/library
```

## Options

When running the script, you'll be prompted with several options:

1. **Album Folder Renaming**
   - Choose whether to add the DR score to the album folder name
   - Example: "2024 - Album Title" â†’ "2024 - Album Title (DR 10)"

2. **Metadata Tagging**
   - Choose how to tag the audio files with DR information:
     - Both VERSION and ROONALBUMTAG tags
     - VERSION tag only
     - ROONALBUMTAG tag only
     - No tagging

3. **Log File Management**
   - Choose whether to rename `foo_dr.txt` to `foo_dr_processed.txt` after successful processing

## Supported File Formats

- MP3
- FLAC
- M4A (AAC)
- DSF

## How It Works

1. The script walks through the specified directory and its subdirectories.
2. It looks for `foo_dr.txt` files, which contain DR information.
3. When found, it extracts the DR value and processes the corresponding audio files and/or folder according to the chosen options.
4. Depending on the settings, it can:
   - Rename the album folder to include the DR value
   - Add DR information to the audio file metadata
   - Mark the log file as processed

## Notes

- The script uses the `mutagen` library to handle audio file metadata.
- It's recommended to backup your music library before running this script, especially if you choose the folder renaming option.
- The script ignores hidden files and directories (those starting with a dot).
